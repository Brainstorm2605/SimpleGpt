This repository contains a clear and well-structured implementation of a GPT-like language model built using PyTorch. 
It's designed for understanding the core concepts of transformer-based language modeling and provides a foundation for exploration and experimentation.

##Key Features

##Readability: The code prioritizes clarity and easy comprehension.
##Customization: Modify hyperparameters such as learning rate, context window size, and network architecture to explore their impact.
##Text Generation: Train the model to generate creative and coherent text samples.
Foundation for Further Development: Use this codebase as a starting point for more advanced NLP projects or customizations.
Project Structure

##SimpleGpt.ipynb: Contains the main model code, including:
Data loading and preprocessing
Transformer model architecture (attention, feedforward layers, etc.)
Training and text generation logic

##Data Preparation:

Place your text dataset in a suitable location.
Update the train_file and val_file paths in SimpleGpt.ipynb accordingly.

##Training:

python SimpleGpt.ipynb
Use code with caution.
Customize hyperparameters within the code as needed.

##Text Generation:

After training, use the generate function in SimpleGpt.ipynb to create new text samples.

##Perplexity: Include the perplexity on your validation set.
##Other Benchmarks: If you've calculated additional metrics, include them here.
